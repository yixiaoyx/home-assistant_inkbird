# TODO
- remove MAC address

This repo adds support for the Inkbird IBS-TH1 under Home Assistant.

![Example Output inside Home Assistant](room-temps.png)

Install this by dropping it into your config folder (path may vary
from install to install). In my install, this would be at
/config/custom_components/inkbird. 

Change your /config/configuration.yaml to have something like;
NOTE: Configuration breaking change. The devices are now under
a subsection.

```
sensor:
  - platform: inkbird
    devices:
      - mac: '90:e2:02:9b:45:3a'
        name: 'Cians Room'
        monitored_conditions:
          - temperature
          - humidity
          - battery
      - mac: '90:e2:02:9b:4b:64'
        name: 'Kats Room'
        monitored_conditions:
          - temperature
          - humidity
          - battery
```

Obviously, the MAC and name you will change to tastes. The MAC you 
can find by using the scan.py inside helper_scripts. You can also
test in a 'once off' fashion by using the test_btle.py with the
changed MAC inside it.

With the rework, almost all of the caveats in the first release are
now obsoleted. Every time a scan_interval is hit (usually 30s or such)
then the Inkbird.Updater will scan the btle for any broadcasts for 10s.
The Inkbird sends out a broadcast every 10s as well. This means that
from time to time, we won't get lucky and listen at the right time.

That said, there is no more btle connections happening (as it's using
broadcasted data from the devices only now). It's also vastly more
power efficient. Battery support has been added as well. Thanks to
Canadian winters, negative temperatures should be registered accordingly.

In short, I am now concluding that the device is "100% supported" and
there probably won't be any more check-ins after this one.
